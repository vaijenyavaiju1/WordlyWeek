In this project, we will build a Spring Boot application to serve as the backend for the 'Wordly Week' application. 'Wordly Week' brings together the worlds of writers and magazines, describing the cooperation and collaborations between them. Users can delve into the application to identify writers who've left their mark on the magazines and discover the range of magazines a single writer has written.

For this application, our main entities are `Writer` and `Magazine`. The `Writer` entity is in a Many-to-Many relationship with the `Magazine` entity.

<details>
<summary>**Implementation Files**</summary>

Use these files to complete the implementation:

- `WriterController.java`
- `WriterRepository.java`
- `WriterJpaService.java`
- `WriterJpaRepository.java`
- `Writer.java`
- `MagazineController.java`
- `MagazineRepository.java`
- `MagazineJpaService.java`
- `MagazineJpaRepository.java`
- `Magazine.java`

Create a database that contains three tables `writer`, `magazine`, and `writer_magazine` using the given database schema.

You can refer to this [session](https://learning.ccbp.in/course?c_id=e345dfa4-f5ce-406e-b19a-4ed720c54136&s_id=6a60610e-79c2-4e15-b675-45ddbd9bbe82&t_id=f880166e-2f51-4403-81a0-d2430694dae8), for creating a database.

_Create the SQL files and compose accurate queries to run the application. Inaccurate SQL files will result in test case failures._
